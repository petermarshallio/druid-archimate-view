# Apache Druid Archimate Model

Archimate is a modelling notation widely adopted amongst Enterprise and Solution Architects, referenced widely in TOGAF.

This repository contains an export of the Archimate Model for Apache Druid, created using Archi.

Both the model and this repository is an Open Source Community effort to create an architectural view of Apache Druid that is also self-documenting.
