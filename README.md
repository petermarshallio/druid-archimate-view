# Apache Druid Archimate Model HTML Export

[Archimate](https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview) is a modelling notation widely adopted amongst Enterprise and Solution Architects, referenced widely in [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf).

This repository contains an export of the Archimate Model for [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org), created using [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Both the model and this repository is an Open Source Community effort to create an architectural view of Apache Druid that is also self-documenting, and all contributions to the Archimate Model itself are welcome.  Please contact [archimate@petermarshall.io](mailto://archimate@petermarshall.io).
